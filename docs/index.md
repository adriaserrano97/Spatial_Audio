For this reason, I'm sure you will want to add music to you game eventually. Not only that, I'm sure you will want to add sfx, dialogue, atmospheric sounds... However, as you may already know, there are a number of ways to go about that. Long past are the days when our games had only a couple channels of audio, delighting us with those ancient 8bit themes. Nowadays, we expect sound in videogames to feel real: if something in game happens on the of the screen, we expect to hear it from there. Just the same as we expect sounds to sound louder the closer they are to the camera. 

Sounds great, doesn't it? Let me show you how to do it!
